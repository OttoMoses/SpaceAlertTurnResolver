Usage:
After loading a new game, input all player actions in the players screen, input threats and their respective zones in the threats screen, select the relevant threat tracks and finally open the resolve screen. 

The "jump to turn" button clears existing text and replaces it with reults text up to the specified turn, the "advance turn" button adds result text for the next turn. 

Damage tiles are shuffeled automatically in during setup so you can go back to any of the setup screens and make changes then rerun the results with consistant damage effects.
